gunnlaug answers i shall go abroad all the same nor shall i be well pleased but if thou further this

so after this illugi rode with eleven men from home down to burg and thorstein greeted him well early in the morning illugi said to thorstein i would speak to thee

let us go then to the top of the burg and talk together there said thorstein and so they did and gunnlaug went with them

then said illugi my kinsman gunnlaug tells me that he has begun a talk with thee on his own behalf praying that he might woo thy daughter helga but now i would fain know what is like to come of this matter his kin is known to thee and our possessions from my hand shall be spared neither land nor rule over men if such things might perchance further matters

thorstein said herein alone gunnlaug pleases me not that i find him an unsettled man but if he were of a mind like thine little would i hang back

illugi said it will cut our friendship across if thou gainsayest me and my son an equal match

thorstein answers for thy words and our friendship then helga shall be vowed but not betrothed to gunnlaug and shall bide for him three winters but gunnlaug shall go abroad and shape himself to the ways of good men but i shall be free from all these matters if he does not then come back or if his ways are not to my liking

thereat they parted illugi rode home but gunnlaug rode to his ship but when they had wind at will they sailed for the main and made the northern part of norway and sailed landward along thrandheim to nidaros there they rode in the harbour and unshipped their goods
chapter seven  of gunnlaug in the east and the west

in those days earl eric the son of hakon and his brother svein ruled in norway earl eric abode as then at hladir which was left to him by his father and a mighty lord he was skuli the son of thorstein was with the earl at that time and was one of his court and well esteemed

now they say that gunnlaug and audun festargram and seven of them together went up to hladir to the earl gunnlaug was so clad that he had on a grey kirtle and white longhose he had a boil on his foot by the instep and from this oozed blood and matter as he strode on in this guise he went before the earl with audun and the rest of them and greeted him well the earl knew audun and asked him tidings from iceland audun told him what there was toward then the earl asked gunnlaug who he was and gunnlaug told him his name and kin then the earl said skuli thorsteins son what manner of man is this in iceland

lord says he give him good welcome for he is the son of the best man in iceland illugi the black of gilsbank and my fosterbrother withal

the earl asked what ails thy foot icelander

a boil lord said he

and yet thou wentest not halt

gunnlaug answers why go halt while both legs are long alike

then said one of the earls men called thorir he swaggereth hugely this icelanderit would not be amiss to try him a little

gunnlaug looked at him and sang

    a courtman there is
    full evil i wis
    a bad man and black
    belief let him lack

then would thorir seize an axe the earl spake let it be says he to such things men should pay no heed but now icelander how old a man art thou

gunnlaug answers i am eighteen winters old as now says he

then says earl eric my spell is that thou shalt not live eighteen winters more

gunnlaug said somewhat under his breath pray not against me but for thyself rather

the earl asked thereat what didst thou say icelander

gunnlaug answers what i thought well befitting that thou shouldst bid no prayers against me but pray well for thyself rather

what prayers then says the earl

that thou mightest not meet thy death after the manner of earl hakon thy father

the earl turned red as blood and bade them take the rascal in haste but skuli stepped up to the earl and said do this for my words lord and give this man peace so that he depart at his swiftest

the earl answered at his swiftest let him be off then if he will have peace and never let him come again within my realm

then skuli went out with gunnlaug down to the bridges where there was an englandbound ship ready to put out therein skuli got for gunnlaug a berth as well as for thorkel his kinsman but gunnlaug gave his ship into auduns ward and so much of his goods as he did not take with him

now sail gunnlaug and his fellows into the english main and come at autumntide south to london bridge where they hauled ashore their ship

now at that time king ethelred the son of edgar ruled over england and was a good lord this winter he sat in london but in those days there was the same tongue in england as in norway and denmark but the tongues changed when william the bastard won england for thenceforward french went current there for he was of french kin

gunnlaug went presently to the king and greeted him well and worthily the king asked him from what land he came and gunnlaug told him all as it was but said he i have come to meet thee lord for that i have made a song on thee and i would that it might please thee to hearken to that song the king said it should be so and gunnlaug gave forth the song well and proudly and this is the burden thereof 

    as god are all folk fearing
    the free lord king of england
    kin of all kings and all folk
    to ethelred the head bow

the king thanked him for the song and gave him as songreward a scarlet cloak lined with the costliest of furs and goldenbroidered down to the hem and made him his man and gunnlaug was with him all the winter and was well accounted for

one day in the morning early gunnlaug met three men in a certain street and thororm was the name of their leader he was big and strong and right evil to deal with he said northman lend me some money

gunnlaug answered that were ill counselled to lend ones money to unknown men

he said i will pay it thee back on a named day

then shall it be risked says gunnlaug and he lent him the fee withal

but some time afterwards gunnlaug met the king and told him of the moneylending the king answered now hast thou thriven little for this is the greatest robber and reiver deal with him in no wise but i will give thee money as much as thine was

gunnlaug said then do we your men do after a sorry sort if treading sackless folk under foot we let such fellows as this deal us out our lot nay that shall never be

soon after he met thororm and claimed the fee of him he said he was not going to pay it

then sang gunnlaug

    evil counselled art thou
    gold from us withholding
    the reddener of the edges
    pricking on with tricking
    wot ye what they called me
    wormtongue yet a youngling
    nor for nought so hight i
    now is time to show it

now i will make an offer good in law says gunnlaug that thou either pay me my money or else that thou go on holm with me in three nights space

then laughed the viking and said before thee none have come to that to call me to holm despite of all the ruin that many a man has had to take at my hands well i am ready to go

thereon they parted for that time

gunnlaug told the king what had befallen and he said now indeed have things taken a right hopeless turn for this mans eyes can dull any weapon but thou shalt follow my rede here is a sword i will give thee  with that thou shalt fight but before the battle show him another

gunnlaug thanked the king well therefor

now when they were ready for the holm thororm asked what sort of sword it was that he had gunnlaug unsheathed it and showed him but had a loop round the handle of the kings sword and slipped it over his hand the bearserk looked on the sword and said i fear not that sword

but now he dealt a blow on gunnlaug with his sword and cut off from him nigh all his shield gunnlaug smote in turn with the kings gift the bearserk stood shieldless before him thinking he had the same weapon he had shown him but gunnlaug smote him his deathblow then and there

the king thanked him for his work and he got much fame therefor both in england and far and wide elsewhere

in the spring when ships sailed from land to land gunnlaug prayed king ethelred for leave to sail somewhither the king asks what he was about then gunnlaug said i would fulfil what i have given my word to do and sang this stave withal

    my ways must i be wending
    three kings walls to see yet
    and earls twain as i promised
    erewhile to landsharers
    neither will i wend me
    back the wormsbed lacking
    by warlords son the wealthfree
    for work done gift well given

so be it then skald said the king and withal he gave him a ring that weighed six ounces but said he thou shalt give me thy word to come back next autumn for i will not let thee go altogether because of thy great prowess
chapter eight  of gunnlaug in ireland

thereafter gunnlaug sailed from england with chapmen north to dublin in those days king sigtrygg silkybeard son of king olaf kvaran and queen kormlada ruled over ireland and he had then borne sway but a little while gunnlaug went before the king and greeted them well and worthily the king received him as was meet then gunnlaug said i have made a song on thee and i would fain have silence therefor

the king answered no men have before now come forward with songs for me and surely will i hearken to thine then gunnlaug brought the song whereof this is the burden

    swarus steed
    doth sigtrygg feed

and this is therein also

    praiseworth i can
    well measure in man
    and kings one by one
    lo here kvarans son
    grudgeth the king
    gift of gold ring
    i singer know
    his wont to bestow
    let the high king say
    heard he or this day
    song drapumeasure
    dearer a treasure

the king thanked him for the song and called his treasurer to him and said how shall the song be rewarded

what hast thou will to give lord says he

how will it be rewarded if i give him two ships for it said the king

then said the treasurer this is too much lord other kings give in reward of songs good keepsakes fair swords or golden rings

so the king gave him his own raiment of new scarlet a goldembroidered kirtle and a cloak lined with choice furs and a gold ring which weighed a mark gunnlaug thanked him well

he dwelt a short time here and then went thence to the orkneys

then was lord in orkney earl sigurd the son of hlodver he was friendly to icelanders now gunnlaug greeted the earl well and said he had a song to bring him the earl said he would listen thereto since he was of such great

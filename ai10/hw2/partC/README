Build with:

gcc *.c -O3 -ansi -Wall -pedantic -o namazon
 
 or
 
gcc *.c -ansi -Wall -pedantic -o namazon -DDEBUG

The latter steps through the solution with 1 iteration per second. This is to make it easier to verify the behaviour of the program, if desired. 

to run the program, pass the boardsize as argument:

namazon [size]

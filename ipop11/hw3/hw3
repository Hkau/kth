1. DNS

- List the (names of the) name servers in the computer-science department (csc.kth.se)! (names, not addresses)

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;csc.kth.se.			IN	NS

;; ANSWER SECTION:
csc.kth.se.		61851	IN	NS	ns2.nada.kth.se.
csc.kth.se.		61851	IN	NS	ns1.nada.kth.se.
csc.kth.se.		61851	IN	NS	a.ns.kth.se.
csc.kth.se.		61851	IN	NS	b.ns.kth.se.

Answer: a.ns.kth.se, b.ns.kth.se, ns1.nada.kth.se & ns2.nada.kth.se.

- List all the IP addresses in the list above! (Don't forget IPv6)

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
a.ns.kth.se.		7200	IN	A	130.237.72.246
a.ns.kth.se.		7200	IN	AAAA	2001:6b0:1::246
b.ns.kth.se.		7200	IN	A	130.237.72.250
ns1.nada.kth.se.	71261	IN	A	130.237.225.4
ns2.nada.kth.se.	77092	IN	A	130.237.222.4

Answer:
a.ns.kth.se => 130.237.72.246 + 2001:6b0:1::246
b.ns.kth.se => 130.237.72.250
ns1.nada.kth.se => 130.237.255.4
ns2.nada.kth.se => 130.237.255.4

- One of the (secondary) nameservers of kth.se is located in Gothenburg (Chalmers). Does its IP address have any other name?

;; ANSWER SECTION:
252.253.16.129.in-addr.arpa. 2036 IN	PTR	charybdis.cdg.chalmers.se.
252.253.16.129.in-addr.arpa. 2036 IN	PTR	ns2.chalmers.se.

Answer: Yes; charybdis.cdg.chalmers.se

- To which mail agents may your email be delivered if you send an email to olofh@csc.kth.se? List the names of all servers.

;; ANSWER SECTION:
csc.kth.se.		3590	IN	MX	0 mx4.nada.kth.se.
csc.kth.se.		3590	IN	MX	0 mx3.nada.kth.se.

Answer: mx3.nada.kth.se & mx4.nada.kth.se

- Which name does the IPv4 address 193.11.23.1 correspond to?

;; ANSWER SECTION:
1.23.11.193.in-addr.arpa. 9572	IN	PTR	lab-fw.netlab.csc.kth.se.

Answer: lab-fw.netlab.csc.kth.se

- Which name does the 2001:700:0:503::aa:5302 correspond to?

2.0.3.5.a.a.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.3.0.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.7.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa domain name pointer nn.uninett.no.

Answer: nn.uninett.no

- Assume you are an administrator at NADA and you wish to change the address of one of its nameservers. You want to shut-down the old server and replace it with a new, and for that you want to use a new IP address. Describe a method to accomplish this where the overlap between the old and new address is not more than a minute (When both addresses are simultaneously accesible). Which entries would you change, and at what period in time would you change them? When can you shut down the old server? You may want to express the method using a time-line. The TTL of the entry is 86400.

Answer:

First, change the TTL of the nameserver's address (A, AAAA) fields to 30 seconds (less than a minute).

Then wait for 86400 (old TTL) seconds, so that you know that no servers are caching the old address for more than 30 seconds.

Now change the nameserver's address field to the new IP, and set the TTL back to 86400 (in that order).

After 30 seconds, the old server can be unplugged. No servers will have this old address cached by now.


2. Distance-vector routing

In the network above, all routers run RIPv2 and all link metrics are one, except between A and C where the link metric is three. Assume an initial state for all routers, where only the directed connected networks are present in the router's routing tables. The destinations in the network are the /24 prefixes (not A, B, ...). There is no equal-cost-multi-path in the network (only one best path). Please note that no destinations in this example should have the metric zero!

2.1 Initial state
What is the initial RIP routing state of A? Express the routes in a routing table as follows:

A's Destination, Metric, Next-hop/-
B, 1, -
C, 3, -

2.2 First step

Assume C is the first router that sends a RIP update to all its neighbours. What is A's routing table after the RIP update from C is recieved?

C's table (Destination, Metric, Next-hop/-)
A, 3, -
B, 1, -
D, 1, -
E, 1, -

Merging this into A's table gives (adding 3 for metric to C):
B, 1, -
C, 3, -
D, 4, C
E, 4, C

2.3 Second step

Assume B is the second router that sends a RIP update to all its neighbors. What is A's routing table after the RIP update from B is recieved? (B has also recieved an update from C).

B's table (Destination, Metric, Next-hop/-)
A, 1, -
C, 1, -
D, 2, C
E, 2, C
F, 1, -

Merging into A's table gives (adding 1 for metric to B):
B, 1, -
C, 3, -
D, 4, C
E, 4, C
F, 2, B

2.4 Final step

After convergence (stable state has been reached), what is the state of A's routing table?

B, 1, -
C, 3, -
D, 3, B
E, 4, C
F, 2, B

2.5 Split-horizon

Assume A uses split-horizon. Define A's distance vector sent on the 10.0.3.0/24 sub-network. That is, which <destination, metric> tuples are sent from A in a RIP response message to B? The state is after convergence.

B, 1, -
C, 3, -
E, 4, C

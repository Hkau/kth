1. Consider the randomized algorithm in the slides for lecture 7. Suppose only
   crash failures happen.

   a: How many crash failures can the algorithm handle? Explain.

   f, the algorithm waits for n-f proposals, as such at most f nodes may have
   crashed.

   b: Modify the algorithm to handle as many crash failures as you can. Explain
      how many crash failures the modified algorithm can handle.

   TODO!!! Something about > 50% perhaps.

2. Devise an algorithm for leader election in asynchronous connected network
   graphs. You may assume that nodes have linearly ordered node identifiers and
   that nodes do not fail. Leader election may at any time be initiated by one
   or more nodes independently of each other. What is the message complexity of
   your algorithm?

   # Leader election is permanent, so any additional or concurrently initiated
     elections must return the same leader.

   # Variant on the Echo algorithm, any node initiating the search will "be the
     root node" and search for the lowest id in the connected network. elect is
	 permanent and may only be run once per node (store and use the already-given
	 value).

	message types:
	 1: (EXP, origin, from)
	 2: (ECHO, origin, from, min_id)
	data structures:
	 1: N := set of neighbors;
	 2: B := map of neighbor sets
	 3: min := minimum id found
	 4: parent := map of parents for each origin
	elect:
	 1: forall n ∈ N send (EXP, this.id, this.id) to n;
	 2: leader = this.id
	 3: while N != {} do:
	 4: 	recieve (ECHO, this.id, n, min_id) # recieve msg with self as origin
	 5: 	leader = min_id if min_id < leader;
	 6:		N := N - {n};
	 7: choose(leader) # The minimum node is now the id
	recieve_exp:
	 1: recieve(EXP, origin != this.id, n) # catch other exp
	 2: min = this.id if min is nil;
	 3: if B[origin] is nil: # new search from origin, otherwise ignore
	 4: 	parent[origin] = n
	 5: 	B[origin] = neighbors - {n};
	 6: 	forall neighbor in B[origin]:
	 7: 		send(EXP, origin, this.id) to neighbor;
	 8: 	if B[origin] == {}: # reply directly if no EXPs sent
	 9:			send(ECHO, origin, this.id, min) to n;
	recieve_echo:
	 1: recieve(ECHO, origin != this.id, n, min_id) # only other origins
	 2: min = min(min, min_id)
	 3: B[origin] := B[origin] - {n};
	 4: if B[origin] == {}: # no subsearches active, reply towards
	 5: 	send(ECHO, origin, this.id, min) to parent[origin];

	Message complexity:
	 The algorithm will flood the entire network and generate at most two
	 messages (EXP+ECHO) per link. This will in total generate O(|E|) messages
	 across the network.

3. Describe which graph problem algorithm foo solves. Prove that foo is
   correct. Prove that it is self-stabilizing. How many rounds are needed for
   the stabilization in the worst case? Explain your reasoning.

   # Hint for question 3: First part of the question may be a little cryptic.
     View the network graph as an ordinary graph with vertices (nodes) and
	 edges (links). When running the algorithm the claim is that the labelling
	 as determined by variable b eventually stabilizes in such a way that the
	 graph with the labelling has a specific property. This could be, for
	 instance: The labelling determines a Hamiltonian circuit, or the
	 labelling determines a connected component (none of these apply, btw).
	 Hope this helps.

   TODO!! :DD

4. Consider the 3PC protocol. Explain how the affected parties act in the
   following situations:

   a: Coordinator and 1 cohort fail in phase 1

   Aborting, no prepare messages can have been sent in this state, so
   commit not agreed upon.

   b: Coordinator and 1 cohort fail in phase 2

   New coordinator can ask if anyone recieved a prepared message, if so
   it can resume, everyone has already agreed upon the commit.

   Otherwise abort the transaction.

   c: Coordinator and 1 cohort fail in phase 3

   If anyone has recieved a commit message, new coordinator can enforce
   the commit.

   d: The coordinator times out in phase 1

   All abort, no one knows if everyone replied yes. New coordinator can restart
   and ask again.

   e: The coordinator times out in phase 2

   New coordinator can restart the protocol. If anyone recieved a prepare,
   resume, since all agree.

   f: The coordinator times out in phase 3

   Resume commiting, all agree, and all know that they agree upon the commit.

5. Suppose Paxos is changed in the following way: The conditional in lines 6-11
   of the pseudocode for Proposer in slide set 9 is replaced by the statement
   Send propose(x, n) to the same set of acceptors.

   Does the agreement property still hold? Explain carefully why or why not.

6. A risk in Byzantine fault recovery procedures is that one or several
   Byzantine replicas conspire to eliminate a non-faulty primary. Explain how
   this is prevented in PBFT and in the Zyzzyva system.

7. In this exercise you may start from the binary tree DHT presented in the
   slides for lecture 10. Describe three attacks a Byzantine adversary might
   mount against DHT and how you would protect against them, by suitably
   modifying the algorithms for search, join and leave. A concise textual
   description is sufficient, you do not need to provide pseudocode, for
   instance.

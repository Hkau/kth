Total score: 100 - ? p = ? p

1 a) OK
  b) OK
  c) OK
  d) OK
  e) OK
  f) Correct AS number, organization is supposed to be SUNET/NORDUnet. Generous
     grading => -1p.

2  There's no route to the next-hop addresses 12.128.64.1-4, so packets can not
   be sent to the /20 networks. Also no interfaces are mentioned in the
   solution, nor flags in the routing table (well, all are probably up, but the
   /20 networks should be under gateway entries).

   The ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL offices have however been well-aggregated into /20
   networks of M, N, O, P.
   
   -? p (I've talked to György and he suggested this)

3 a) OK
  b) OK
  c) No, this link is not up, so the packet is either sent to the default route
     or simply dropped. -4p.
  d) OK
  e) OK

4 a) OK
  b) OK
  c) OK (note that the fragmentation info will take an additional 8 bytes, even
     though it doesn't matter).

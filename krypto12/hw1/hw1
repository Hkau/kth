1) Ciphers

a) Substitution cipher (single character)
b) Rotation + subst bigraph?
c) hex-encoded something?

2) Which functions are neglegible?

 - 1: 10^-50*n^-5.7 # No, inversely polynomial
 - 2: f1(n)^n # yes, even smaller than 1/n!, so smaller than inversely exponential
 - 3: 2^-log(n)^(1+d)
 - 4: n^(-10-1/n³) # no, as 1/n³ goes to 0, left will be n⁻¹⁰, which is inversely polynomial
 - 5: n^(1/2)*2^(-log(n)^(1/3))

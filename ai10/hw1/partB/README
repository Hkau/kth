This script runs on the python 2.6 version available as 'python' in CSC's 
computer rooms. Tested on Ubuntu.

run `python drone.py`

This will run the scripts, executing best-first, dfs, and finally bfs. In that 
order. The script takes approximately 2-3 minutes to finish, with most time 
being spent on the BFS.

The script will then report the number of expanded nodes during the search. 
Invalid moves are failed and do not count as an expanded node. It will also 
print the room's state and which moves the robot took to get there. The moves 
are indexed in the same way Javier did in an attached image explaining the 
moves.

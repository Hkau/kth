Total score: 100 - 20p = 80p

1 a) OK
  b) OK
  c) OK
  d) OK
  e) OK
  f) Correct AS number, organization is supposed to be SUNET/NORDUnet. Generous
     grading => -1p.

2) There's no route to the next-hop addresses 12.128.64.1-4, so packets can not
   be forwarded to the /20 networks. Also neither interfaces nor flags are
   mentioned in the routing table (well, all are probably up, but the /20
   networks should be under gateway entries).

   The ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL offices have however been well-aggregated into /20
   networks of M, N, O, P.

	Q, R, S and T are networks, not hosts. The computers on Q, R, S, T are just
	connected to those networks directly.
   
   -15 p (I've talked to György who gave the following response, and I graded
   it the highest suggested amount.)

   Hi,

   It is really up to you. Since the aggregation is correct, that should be 
   worth some points. The forwarding table seems to be messed up, however.
   It could possibly be worth half the points or a bit less, but the 
   decision is yours.

   Best,
     György

3 a) OK
  b) OK
  c) No, this link is not up, so the packet is either sent to the default route
     or simply dropped. -4p.
  d) OK
  e) OK

4 a) OK
  b) OK
  c) OK (note that the fragmentation info will take an additional 8 bytes, even
     though it doesn't matter).

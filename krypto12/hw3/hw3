1a: DH hard -> DL hard

To prove that the Diffie-Hellman assumption implies the Discrete Logarithm
assumption we're going to prove that DL being false implies that DH is false as
well. (DH->DL is equal to !DL->!DH).

DL being false means that the probability that an polynomial-time adversary A
which yields A(g,y) = log_g(y) with non-negligible probability.

Recall that a function e(n) being negligible means that e(n) < 1/n^c for every
constant c > 0 and n>n0 for some n0. Thus if Pr[A(g,y) = log_g(y)] >= 1/n^c for
some c.

To prove that !DL->!DH we're going to construct a new algorithm A' which can
solve DH with non-negligible probability using our polynomial-time adversary
A for solving DL. (A'(g^a, g^b) should yield g^ab with non-negligible
probability.)

A' (g^a, g^b):
	a = A(g, g^a)
	b = A(g, g^b)
	return g^ab

This new adversary A' makes use of A twice. Each attempt of using A succeeding
with probability p means that A' succeeds with probability p^2. Thus if
Pr[A(g,y) = log_g(y)] >= 1/n^c for some c, then Pr[A'(g^a, g^b) = g^ab] >=
(1/n^c)^2 = 1/n^2c. 2c is still only a constant, and it follows that A' is not
negligible if A is.

Thus !DL implies !DH and equivalently DH implies DL.
